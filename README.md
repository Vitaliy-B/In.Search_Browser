# In.Search Browser
Test app based on WebView with intellectual (morphological) search on page for Android.  
Used OpenNLP and WordNet via JWI.

----------------------------------------
To perform search on page app requires NLP data loaded into SD-card.  
It could be found in archive [In.Search_Browser/data/NLP data on MP/NLP.zip](/data/NLP data on MP/NLP.zip).  
Archive content should be placed in "/storage/emulated/0/Documents/NLP/" which is equal to "SD-card -> Documents -> NLP".
